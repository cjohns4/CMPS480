MODULE 1: Project1 For this module, complete the following:

Set up a common Slack channel for the team. Invite the instructor. Create a common GitHub repository for the team. Invite the instructor. Pick a team leader. The team leader is should contact the instructor when there are problems. Several options for ideas are usually offered by the instructor, though you can propose your own if you want. But the selected idea has to be approved by the instructor. Complete a first version of the business model canvas for your idea (it is expected to change). Commit it to the GitHub repository. Set up your jail so that you each of you can run the projects on your own. Create you own GitHub branch from which you work. Then create pull requests to merge into master. Do this at least once for the first module, to make sure you are ready for the upcoming modules. Once you are done, submit the following:

A link to a live version of the project for the this module. A link to the GitHub repository of the project for the this module. Any concerns you have about the project at this. Note that you should include a brief summary of your contributions under Communication and Research. Make sure none of the parts of your submission change and keep working. For example, you may want to create a separate branch in GitHub and have a different URL in your jail for each module.

MODULE 2: Building a Prototype: Requirements, Architecture, APIs, and Security Project2 For this module, complete the following:

Each student in the group should develop at least one detailed use case. Create a box-and-line diagram to display the software architecture. The boxes are the components and must include front end, back end, and a database (mention specific technologies that you will be using). The lines represent interactions and you should include some details. Each use case should be supported by the API. Create a simple first version that shows the URL, the input JSON, and the output JSON. You must include examples. Create a security document in which you answer at least the following questions: How do you make sure the system is secure and data safe? What data is sensitive? (see here) How will you protect it? What specific technologies will you use for protection? E.g., HTTPS. Once you are done, submit the following:

A link to a live version of the project for the this module. A link to the GitHub repository of the project for the this module. Any concerns you have about the project at this. Note that you should include a brief summary of your contributions under Communication and Research. Make sure none of the parts of your submission change and keep working. For example, you may want to create a separate branch in GitHub and have a different URL in your jail for each module.

Module 3: Building a Prototype: The Front End Project3 For this module, complete the following:

Create a functional (working) interface. Implement all agreed upon use cases. Create one or multiple HTML pages. Add styling with CSS. Add interactivity with JavaScript. Simulate interaction with the server (hard code JSON responses). The interface should be minimal because you only have a week. If necessary, simplify. Once you are done, submit the following:

A link to a live version of the project for the this module. A link to the GitHub repository of the project for the this module. Any concerns you have about the project at this. Note that you should include a brief summary of your contributions under Communication and Research. Make sure none of the parts of your submission change and keep working. For example, you may want to create a separate branch in GitHub and have a different URL in your jail for each module.

Module 4: Building a Prototype: The Back End Project4 For this module, complete the following:

Create a data model (use draw.io) Create a database design (use the MySQL Workbench) Implement the database design (use the MySQL Workbench) Implement the web server using node.js and Express (preferably) Modify the front end to make actual calls to the server (use AJAX) Once you are done, submit the following:

A link to a live version of the project for the this module. A link to the GitHub repository of the project for the this module. Any concerns you have about the project at this. Note that you should include a brief summary of your contributions under Communication and Research. Make sure none of the parts of your submission change and keep working. For example, you may want to create a separate branch in GitHub and have a different URL in your jail for each module. Introduction - The projects aim is to create a website that will allow hikers to locate hikes they may like in a simplified easy manner.

Module 5: Building a Prototype: Business Analytics Project5 For this module, complete the following:

Find a problem that can be solved with business analytics If possible, visualize the data Design a solution to the business analytics problem Embed the business analytics solution in the prototype (either on the front end or back end) Once you are done, submit the following:

A link to a live version of the project for the this module. A link to the GitHub repository of the project for the this module. Any concerns you have about the project at this. Note that you should include a brief summary of your contributions under Communication and Research. Make sure none of the parts of your submission change and keep working. For example, you may want to create a separate branch in GitHub and have a different URL in your jail for each module.

Module 6: Building a Prototype: Finding Customers Project6 For this module, complete the following:

You have to get out of the building (may be a bit uncomfortable) Create and document hypotheses about what your customers need and how they would use the product Perform customer discovery and validate the hypotheses (i.e., is what you build so far useful or does it have to change? Each team member should interview at least 3 people Update the business model canvas based on your findings Once you are done, submit the following:

A link to a live version of the project for the this module. A link to the GitHub repository of the project for the this module. Any concerns you have about the project at this. Note that you should include a brief summary of your contributions under Communication and Research. Make sure none of the parts of your submission change and keep working. For example, you may want to create a separate branch in GitHub and have a different URL in your jail for each module.

Module 7: Refining the Prototype Project7 For this module, complete the following:

Based on the customer discovery for the last module, create GitHub issues to document which changes should be made In addition, determine which components need improvement and include it as issues as well Resolve the GitHub issues Make sure the prototype is close to being production ready Once you are done, submit the following:

A link to a live version of the project for the this module. A link to the GitHub repository of the project for the this module. Any concerns you have about the project at this.
